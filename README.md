# SaaS

This repository holds information about where to find OpenShift templates for the DSaaS.

# Service YAML

```
services:
- hash: aab9fc5fa5c24360079998f2209b2b55c3af29ae
  hash_length: 6
  name: some-name
  path: /openshift/template.yaml
  url: https://github.com/org/repo/
  parameters:
    SOME_PARAM: some_value
```

* *hash*: Commit hash or branch which is used a) for downloading OpenShift template and b) to generate image tag for template processing (`master` is translated to `latest`)
* *hash_length*: Number of characters to be used from *hash* as an image tag
* *name*: Name of the service
* *path*: Path to the template in the repo
* *url*: URL of the repository which contains the template
* *parameters*: An object where key is the parameter name and value is the parameter value. These parameters will be added to `oc process` when processing the template

## Basic Usage

```
python saasherder/cli.py -h
```

You can pull all the templates by running

```
python saasherder/cli.py -D dsaas-templates -s dsaas-services/ pull
```

You'll find the downloaded templates in `dsaas-templates/` dir.

You can update commit hash in the `$service.yaml` file by running

```
python saasherder/cli.py -D dsaas-templates -s dsaas-services/ update -o foo.yaml hash core b52c33c8f6c40a5dca70c8b3c25387b01881bf2d
```

This will create file `foo.yaml` which will be a copy of file `services/core.yaml` with updated commit hash for `core` service.

You can also process downloaded templates to use commit hash as an image tag.

```
python saasherder/cli.py -D dsaas-templates -s dsaas-services/ template --output-dir test tag
```

This will take templates in `dsaas-templates/` and commit hashes in `dsaas-services/*.yaml` and produce processed template to `test/` directory.
It requires `oc` binary to be present on path and logged into some OpenShift instance (it actually calls `oc process` to leverage existing tooling)

## Jenkins Update

All of the SaaS services are built in CentOS CI. There is missing piece in automatic update of service.yaml files in this repo. To overcome this, `jenkins-update.py`
was created. It goes over the services in this repo and checks status of latest build in CI. If it's `SUCCESS` it updates commit has with the one from the CI build.

The usage is as simple as

```
python jenkins-update.py
```

You can easily check updated services with `git diff`


## dsaas-tracking-services
these are tracking services that we are not deploying via saas, but come via another pipeline
we still need to track where to get the content, and the ver deployed
